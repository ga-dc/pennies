# Pennies!

In groups of 4 or 5. Designate one person to keep time.

Every group will receive 20 pennies.

The idea of this exercise is for every person in the group to flip each penny over once.

The person designated as the timer will start time as soon as the first penny is flipped and end time when the last person has flipped over the last penny.

## 1st Iteration
For the first iteration, Each person will flip over all twenty pennies than pass all 20 to the next person until each person has flipped over every penny.

## 2nd Iteration
For the next iteration, each person will flip over 5 pennies of the 20, than pass those 5 to the next person. They will repeat this until all 20 pennies are flipped and passed to the next person.

## 3rd Iteration
For the last iteration, each person will flip 1 penny and pass it to the next person.

## Note
- You aren't allowed to flip pennies until they are passed to you, unless you are the first person that has the pennies.
