# Pennies!

This simulation is designed to demonstrate the values of some of the principles of Lean/Agile Methodologies.

We will be simulating moving items through a system.  This could be products on an assembly line or user stories in a development project.

The idea of this exercise is for every person in the group to flip each penny over once.

Separate into groups of about 7. Designate two people to keep time.

Every group will receive 20 pennies.  One random group receives 20 coins of varying values (5 each).

Each group will have a "whole group" timer and a "single worker" timer.
- The "group timer" will start time as soon as the first penny is flipped and end time when the last person has flipped over the last penny.
- The "single worker" timer will measure the time from when the *last* worker receives their first penny, till they flip the last penny.

Each group will enter their times in ??? TODO: spreadsheet.

## 1st Iteration
For the first iteration, each person will flip over all twenty pennies, using only their left hand.  Once they have flipped ALL 20, they can then pass ALL 20 to the next person, until each person has flipped over every penny.

## 2nd Iteration
For the next iteration, the batch size is 5.  Each person will flip over 5 pennies of the 20, again using only their left hand, than pass those 5 to the next person. They will repeat this until all 20 pennies are flipped and passed to the next person. Once you have received 5 pennies, you can start flipping and sending groups of 5.

## 3rd Iteration
For the next iteration, each person will flip 1 penny and immediately pass it to the next person.

At this point, identify which batch size is best, for your group, and continue with that "optimal" batch size.

Given time, discuss.
> Q. How do you think we can improve the speed?
---

## 4th Iteration
Pick a suggested optimization.
Recommended: 2 hands

## 5th Iteration
Use optimal batch size, simlate localized optimization.  Once a worker has completed their batch, they can help other workers, but only with left hand (simulating reduced familiarity with work).

## 6th Iteration
The group that received the 20 coins of varying values will run once more, this time the first person only choses 10 coins (half the total inventory), but chooses wisely.  Simulating, prioritizing by value.

## Note
- You aren't allowed to flip pennies until they are passed to you (unless you are the first person).
